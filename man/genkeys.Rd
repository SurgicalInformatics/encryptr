\usage{
genkeys(private_key_name = "id_rsa",
  public_key_name = paste0(private_key_name, ".pub"),
  password = ask_pass())
}
\arguments{
\item{private_key_name}{Character string. Do not change default unless good
reason.}

\item{public_key_name}{Character string. Do not change default unless good
reason.}

\item{password}{Password for private key. This password cannot be recovered
if lost, so please store the password in a safe location.}
}
\value{
Two files containing the public key and encrypted private key are
  written to the working directory.
}
\description{
The first step for the \code{encryptr} workflow is to create a pair of
encryption keys. This uses the \code{\link{openssl}} package. The public key
is used to encrypt information and can be shared. The private key allows
decryption of the encrypted information. It requires a password to be set.
This password cannot be recovered if lost. If the file is lost or
overwritten, any data encrypted with the public key cannot be decrypted.
